      <h3>Basketball</h3>
      <p>Basketball is the sport I enjoy watching most and played throughout my life, It allowed me to stay fit and atheletic as a kid and gave me something to do when I was outside with my friends. My favorite player is Kobe Bryant, because of his tenacity and work ethic, he always preformed when he was on the court.</p>
